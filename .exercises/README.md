# .exercises

In this directory you will find scripts that will exercise the Sharrow library.
The initial exercises are `mtc` and `sandag`, which include bash scripts that
will reproduce the respective example model's unit tests that are otherwise run
using GitHub Actions.  This allows the user to easily test those examples locally.
